//////////////////////////////

really really have to be careful with both the amount of work that is shown on each page as well as the size of it all - I really do have to go for a lower amount of work on each page (100 or less?) as well as a smaller total file size on each page (50mb or less?)

I want to show more work for variety and range, as well as show it all in high quality, but that reality is practically impossible for me to achieve - unless I completely switched up my "framework" and re-coded the galleries so that they utilized a type of "smart thumbnail" system with smarter loading as well.

For now, I will have to bring that number of work down and compress it stronger for easier loading and a smoother browsing experience.
