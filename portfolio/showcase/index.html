			<h3 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; font-size: 35px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 35px;" id="content-text">Outliers - All Steps - Final - Infographic</h3>
			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">After reading the book, Outliers, and creating all five infographics for the different topics discussed in it, our class was tasked with producing a grand final piece, putting together all of our infographics into one huge, beautiful display. The topics ranged from The Matthew Effect and the ten thousand hour rule, to taking advantage of opportunities and understanding the effects that cultural legacies can have in certain situations. I had at first struggled to create a certain style for each of my infographics since I am not very creative, but I got the hang of it all once I had some time to think about what I was really going to do for my particular take on the whole assignment. I really enjoyed putting together this gigantic poster because of the extra, valuable experience it gave me with building an extremely high resolution picture and expertly crafting it to my liking with every small tweak I had made overtime with it. I chose this graphic and displayed it as the first on my showcase page because I was really proud of the quality and the amount of content I had put into the whole thing in the end. Not only did I just put all of the infographics onto one piece, but I also had to create a nice title and attractive borders around each infographic.</p>

			<h3 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; font-size: 35px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 35px;" id="content-text">Aquaponics - Science - Lab Report</h3>
			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">Near the end of my sophomore year at Crater High School, our science teacher had assigned the class a massive aquaponics project. This is most likely the biggest project I have constructed in Crater High School so far. I had to include everything I had generated in this assignment, from the ideas for the blueprint of the aquaponics system I had discovered online, to each and every piece of the poster we were required to make for our system, including various pictures and information on how we had completed the whole entire project. I very much enjoyed working on this aquaponics project because I got to work along with a team (but as always I did a lot of the work). Surprisingly, our aquaponics system had won the best in the entire class and was the one used to conduct all of the rest of our experiments on and collect all of our data that we would need in order to complete the rest of the project for our final display. I chose this piece as my first segment of writing because it shows that I can still work well with a team and put a lot of hard work into what I am doing when I am focused, driven, and motivated to do so.</p>

			<h3 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; font-size: 35px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 35px;" id="content-text">Crater Foundation - Marketing Poster</h3>
			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">The Crater Foundation is a nonprofit organization that was established in the year 1992 to aid graduating students in District 6. The foundation provides scholarship assistance to all graduating Seniors at Crater High School who apply for one. They also provide scholarship assistance to students continuing their education (after completing at least one year of college), provide financial aid to students and families in need, supply funds to purchase necessary items such as coats, shoes, school supplies, and classroom materials. The Crater Foundation also helps out by funding special building projects and athletic facility improvements. The Crater Foundation has awarded over $3.8 million in scholarships to Crater High graduates, which is absolutely incredible for both them and all of the students they have helped. During the first trimester of our first year in CSB at Crater High School, our class was assigned with producing a marketing poster for The Crater Foundation. I enjoyed doing this assignment because not only did I get to learn more about photo editing, but I also got to learn a lot about the organization that I was creating the poster for. </p>

			<h3 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; font-size: 35px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 35px;" id="content-text">Cambiar El Mundo - Spanish - Infographic</h3>
			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">In Spanish 2, we were tasked with constructing an infographic that had to do with the past things that we had been doing both inside and outside of the class. We were “changing the world in 30 days” by doing different tasks that rendered positivity each and every day, from opening the door for people and giving out compliments, to donating food, clothing, and other important things. For this infographic assignment, we had to choose one of the tasks that we had done and talk about how it changes the world and why it is important to do that certain thing. I decided to go a bit more broad with my task because it is much easier for people to do it even if they do not want to put much effort into it at all. I wrote about and showed how smiling can change the world by altering people’s moods and just having a much more positive experience in life with others. Smiling can always make a difference and it is just so easy to do it. This is why I chose the topic of something simple, such as smiling. I wanted to showcase this Spanish infographic because it can both show my spanish skills and my graphic creating skills. It also shows how I can do many different styles of graphics for posters, flyers, infographics, etc. I had a great time exploring the different ways to go about making it and how I had finished it all up in the end.</p>

			<h3 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; font-size: 35px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 35px;" id="content-text">Business Marketing Plan - Intro To Marketing</h3>
			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">In my sophomore class, Intro To Marketing, we were tasked with the biggest assignment we would be getting in the class - creating a marketing plan for our own, made up business. Now, this was quite a tough assignment since I was not really that well associated with how businesses operated and how a marketing plan was done, but throughout the class and the long days, our group pulled through and created a great marketing plan for our fake, little silly business that had to do with cooking as chefs. I really quite enjoyed putting together this tremendous marketing plan because I had to learn a lot to get through the whole assignment and work my hardest to get the best amount of content and quality of content I could. We also made an outstanding slideshow that I had put a lot of work into and looked at every detail for it. This assignment shows that I am quite a perfectionist and I can learn new things quickly to get the job done however I can. Exploring all of these important business and marketing pieces really expanded our knowledge on how the real, actual world works, and that is amazing.</p>

			<h3 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; font-size: 35px; padding-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 35px;" id="content-text">2017 - Crater High School of BIS - Exhibition Poster</h3>
			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">As always in CSB, our teachers assigned our class another task to create an informational poster for an important BIS event. We were to create a flyer or poster for the eighth annual BIS exhibition event, where the parents, loved ones, and/or guardians of Crater BIS students come and visit the school to see the work their sons and daughters have completed for each class and put on for display. I loved making this poster because of the simple color scheme that I came up with to get it to look clean and sleak. I also love making the backgrounds for these kind of posters because I start them from scratch and use many different effects to get it to the way I want it to. In this particular edit, I had decided to experiment with using different types of fonts, using lines for small borders in between assets, and using opacity on certain portions of the background to change how text would look behind a certain background color and pattern. I wanted to showcase this piece because it shows how I have evolved in this class and adapted to the requirements I need to always hit on point to get a good grade in the class. I have really improved my skills with constructing and generating many different graphics to showcase in my work each and everyday and this is a tremendous change that is necessary throughout life in order to improve overtime.</p>

			<h3 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; font-size: 35px; padding-bottom: 6px; padding-top: 35px;" id="content-text">Lawrencium - Chemistry - Top Facts - Infographic</h3>
			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">During the first trimester of chemistry in my junior year, my class was to research and create an infographic on any element on the periodic table by our choice, but there was only one element per person. I had chosen the element lawrencium, a synthetic chemical element named in honor of Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron, a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements, and may still be used to discover radioactive elements. I liked making this informational poster because I got to show all of the different facts that I had learned for the whole project and share them with the class. I am showcasing this piece because this shows how much I have improved in my photo editing skills and how I can integrate a lot of information on a certain topic (or many topics) into one image. Just like the outliers piece but on a more smaller scale.</p>

			<h3 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; font-size: 35px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 35px;" id="content-text">The Bosnian Genocide - History - Report</h3>
			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">In one of the toughest classes I had taken so far, named World History Studies and English, taught by Rebecca Campbell, our class had been assigned with creating a huge project on a genocide of our choice. We got to pick a single partner, research, write, and type a gigantic paper on the genocide me and my partner had chosen. We chose the Bosnian genocide and we did a ton of reading and typing on it. I really hated doing this project because of the sheer amount of work we had to do for it, but at the exact same time I had really enjoyed doing the project because I was greatly challenged and put to work. That entire school year was a nightmare because of the amount of work we were getting from classes, but it was mainly this class. But I somehow overcame it and got all A’s that school year in every trimester. I wanted to showcase this simply because of that. I was overwhelmed, but I overcame this humongous obstacle and did the best I could to construct the greatest poster, display, and speech.</p>

			<h3 style="color: #fff; text-align: center; font-size: 35px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 35px;" id="content-text">Crater High School - Comet Cosmos Dance - Poster</h3>
			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">This is another graphic made during my first year in CSB. There was going to be a dance at Crater High School and our teachers wanted the CSB class to create some posters to help promote the special occasion. I really liked making this poster because I in this particular edit I was messing around with adding different particle effects to the foreground and warping the text a bit to give it all a different look than usual and I think it turned out pretty good. I had also, again made my own background from scratch, but you can really only barely see it. I felt I should showcase this graphic because it shows that I can experiment with many different things to get some pretty good results in the end.</p>

			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">Now<a style="color: #ffffd3;" href="https://notseanwalters.github.io/seanwalters/assets/images/civil1.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> is another one of the assignments from one of the hardest classes I had taken so far, named World History Studies and English, taught by Rebecca Campbell, where our class, individually, was to create a big infographic on someone who took part in the civil rights movement. As you can probably tell, I had spent a very long time constructing this gigantic piece filled with information and graphics to help show the teacher and the class that I really cared about my work, what I was learning, and what I turned in, in the end. This is the reason why I chose to showcase this - to show how hard working I am. Also, again, I hated working on it because of the amount of work I had inputted into this thing, but I also loved making it because it really challenged me to overcome this huge assignment and just get it done.</p>

			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;"><a style="color: #ffffd3;" href="https://notseanwalters.github.io/seanwalters/assets/docs/mathportfolio.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a math portfolio that was done back in my freshman year of High School. Our class was tasked with creating a small portfolio, showcasing and discussing the things we had been learning in class. I started with a cover letter, introducing the lessons we were being taught. Then I went more in-depth and explained each paper that was made for every lesson. Next I talked about and showed my personal growth so far in the class and outside of the class. Then lastly, my self-assessment on the whole assignment, including the papers that were used in the portfolio, and the portfolio itself. I chose to showcase this because it shows that I was able construct a small portfolio for math back in my freshman year and it also shows that I am able to discuss and address different things in my work that are important to do so.</p>

			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">This is yet another graphic that was assigned to our class in CSB. The Crater Powder Puff event was coming up and the school needed some helping hands in spreading information about the events, so they turned to CSB to have the class produce posters for the Powder Puff event. I made my own background from scratch, started adding titles and information on the left, leaving room on the right for some other graphics, such as the Crater Powder Puff logo and the girl playing flag football. It’s pretty simple I would say. I enjoyed making this poster because this was the second version I had made since I wanted to improve my original poster and I did exactly that! I wanted to showcase this piece because it, once again, shows off my graphic design skills.</p>

I enjoyed making this one because I got to, once again, mess around with different styles within programs and create many different looking posters for events. I wanted to showcase this because of just that - because it shows off yet another style of graphic that I have made and it was very simple to make for me.</p>

			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">During my freshman year in History class, we were tasked with creating a poster on an invention and I chose to do my poster on the telegraph. <a style="color: #ffffd3;" href="https://notseanwalters.github.io/seanwalters/assets/docs/telegraphs.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a>, you can see all of my work for this poster, compiled into one pdf. I enjoyed making this poster because I got to learn about the history of the telegraph and I wanted to showcase this work because it can show off my skills in creating content to be put up onto a poster, including chunks of text and pictures that go along with them and even captions.</p>

			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">For the big, final project in math my junior year, our group was to create an image, split it into fourths, and, in some way, have each group member draw their fourth of the image. Our group started off by making some ideas for our image, but also make sure it didn't have many lines because we were to graph the image and find the equations for each line, including each point's coordinates. For the first attempt at creating an image, I just decided at home to, for fun, make an image by “simplifying” an picture of Eric Andre and <a style="color: #ffffd3;" href="https://notseanwalters.github.io/seanwalters/assets/images/eric.png" target="_blank">here</a> is the evolution of that image.</p>

I came up with the idea for making Rick from Rick and Morty our actual, final image for the math project, but I didn't produce the image itself. One of the group members, <a href="http://garrettchiz.ddns.net/" target="_blank">Garrett Chisholm</a>, had created the final image, but <a style="color: #ffffd3;" href="https://notseanwalters.github.io/seanwalters/assets/images/rick.png" target="_blank">here</a>, you can see my go at making a simplified image of Rick from Rick and Morty. This is the evolution of that image.</p>

			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">During my sophomore year at Crater High School, I took an elective class called Creative Writing, and for our final project in the class, we were to individually write a short story, combining all of the small pieces that helped construct the story, and putting it all into a poster. As you can see <a style="color: #ffffd3;" href="https://notseanwalters.github.io/seanwalters/assets/docs/3012.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, I compiled all of the pieces of writing and pictures that went into the project and put them into this pdf <a style="color: #ffffd3;" href="https://notseanwalters.github.io/seanwalters/assets/docs/3012.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I enjoyed putting the whole story together because I got to explore the creative side of my mind. I really enjoy writing stories sometimes. I wanted to showcase this story because it shows how creative I can be.</p>

I worked with <a href="https://beta.alscenic.com/" target="_blank">Kyle Lamothe</a>, a second year in CSB at the time, but I did pretty much all of the work because I decided to just do it all at home. <a href="https://beta.alscenic.com/" target="_blank">Kyle</a> helped with giving me ideas at first in the beginning with the rough draft, which was then expanded into the final infographic. I spent a ton of time on this infographic, paying a lot of attention to all of the little details integrated into the graphic. I enjoyed working on this assignment because I got to show off my initial skill with photo editing in class. I wanted to showcase this picture because it shows how I have started in CSB, within only the first week or two, which is great for comparison.</p>

			<p id="content-text" style="text-indent: 40px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">These are some images of me just messing around with photo editing at home, starting from scratch. It was initially the background for the spanish infographic, Cambiar El Mundo, but I decided to make it a separate image as well as the background for the spanish infographic. I really enjoyed making these images because I got to show off some of my little creativity from starting with nothing but a blank slate. I wanted to showcase these images because they show how creative I can get and how I can make some interesting images from scratch.</p>

I duplicated text, deleted text, added text, and moved text to completely mess with the original image. I really enjoy doing this because it is just fun to see what certain change can happen with modifying the text that makes up the photo. Afterwards I converted the text back into a photo to see the results, and <a style="color: #ffffd3;" href="https://notseanwalters.github.io/seanwalters/assets/images/kmshowcase.png" target="_blank">here</a> are the best ones.</p>
