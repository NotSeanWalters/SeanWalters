			<h3 style="color: #f4f4f4; text-align: center;font-size: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; padding-top: 30px;" id="content-text">About Southern Oregon University</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px; padding-bottom: 30px;" id="content-text">Southern Oregon University was established in 1872, founded in 1926, and was formally known as Southern Oregon College (SOC) and Southern Oregon State College (SOSC). Southern Oregon University is a public liberal arts college and is located in Ashland,
				Oregon. As stated on their website, this is what Southern Oregon University thinks about themselves: “The faculty and staff at Southern Oregon University are dedicated to your success at every level. Our programs are challenging, creative and practical.
				Students connect what they learn with the community through internships, capstone projects, and research.”
			</p>
			<h3 style="color: #f4f4f4; text-align: center;font-size: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; padding-top: 30px;" id="content-text">Mission Statement</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px; padding-bottom: 30px;" id="content-text">Southern Oregon University’s mission is to have Southern Oregon University as “an inclusive campus community dedicated to student success, intellectual growth, and responsible global citizenship.”
			</p>
			<h3 style="color: #f4f4f4; text-align: center;font-size: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; padding-top: 30px;" id="content-text">My Own Description of Southern Oregon University</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px; padding-bottom: 30px;" id="content-text">In my opinion, Southern Oregon University seems to be a great public college that is integrated with the surrounding nature all around and offers a lot of various programs in many categories such as business, criminology, natural sciences, and economics.
				As I said before, Southern Oregon University is located in Ashland and every year, Ashland gets 21 inches of rain, 3 inches of snow, and there are 75 days with any measurable precipitation. The elevation in Ashland is around 2,000 feet and there are
				198 sunny days per year on average. In Ashland, the average highest temperature in July is 88 degrees and the average lowest temperature in January is 30 degrees. Southern Oregon University is surrounded by beautiful landscape made up of bright green
				grassy hills, gorgeous trees, and arresting mountains with snow visible at the peaks. Southern Oregon University has a recreation center named Raider Rec that offers various recreational activities that are student focused, such as club sports, Executive
				Club and Sports Council (ECSC), and intramural sports. Southern Oregon University has both on campus housing and off campus housing. There are four residence hall options for Southern Oregon University students on campus and the off campus student
				apartments (and family housing) are conveniently located only two blocks away from campus and houses over 200 students, faculty, staff, and their families. The size of the Southern Oregon University campus is approximately 175 acres and Ashland, Oregon
				is 6.6 square miles.

			<p style="text-indent: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px; padding-bottom: 30px;" id="content-text">Ashland is a city in Jackson County, in the State of Oregon, that lies along Interstate 5 approximately 16 miles north of the border of California to Oregon and is near the south end of the Bear Creek Valley, a branch of the Rogue Valley.

			<p style="text-indent: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px; padding-bottom: 30px;" id="content-text">The student-faculty ratio at Southern Oregon University is 23:1 and the school has 40.9 percent of its classes with fewer than 20 students. Southern Oregon University students in the computer science program “often mention the benefits of small classroom
				sizes, accessibility to faculty, ability to apply learning to real world situations and specialized academic interests, and living in a community with a great climate and amazing choices of activities, events, and the pursuit of interests.” - Inside
				Southern Oregon University.

				credits or CS 380 - Visual Basic 4 credits, CS 326 - Systems Software and Architecture 4 credits, and CS 469 - Systems Analysis 4 credits. The also require to choose the CPS, CIS, CMM, or CSIA option and complete the additional requirements for that
				option, then for the CPS, CIS, or CSIA option, complete 16 additional credits from computer science courses above the 250 level, as approved by the faculty advisor. And for the CMM option, complete 20 additional credits above the 250 level with a
				CS prefix, as approved by the faculty advisor. Lastly, maintain a GPA of at least 2.5 in upper division computer science courses. I will have to keep all of these requirements in my head while attending and slowly working hard towards my degree and
				major.

			<p style="text-indent: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px; padding-bottom: 30px;" id="content-text">The in-state tuition and fees for Southern Oregon University undergraduates is around $8,000. The room and board fees add a lot to the total, if you were to use their “Greensprings” housing with meals plan. The estimated annual cost for books and supplies
				is $999.
			</p>
			<h3 style="color: #f4f4f4; text-align: center;font-size: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; padding-top: 30px;" id="content-text">Living Expenses</h3>

For their “Shasta” housing (and meals), it costs $13,440. But I will most likely not be using these expensive housing and meals plans, and
				instead will be living in an apartment with a friend or two and splitting the pay for the apartment (I do not know how much exactly it will cost).
