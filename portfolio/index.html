				<h3 style="font-size: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; color: white;">My Personal Legend</h3>
				<p style="text-indent: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px; padding-bottom: 23px;">I think that the definition of a personal legend is something that is already set out for you to do and accomplish in your life - you just have to find it. In my mind, I feel that my personal legend is to continue doing great in school, getting all
					A’s, and then moving onto college to help put focus onto my future career. I will focus on school, complete all of my assignments with tons of effort, and hopefully maybe even study in things that I am interested in at classes in school. Once I finish
					all of this hard work in high school I shall move onto finding a college and attending one to further improve my skills to help find myself a career for my future. I am not sure which college to go to at the moment yet, but I am certain I will attend
					a college to help improve the skills I will need for my future career. The college I am currently considering out of any is Southern Oregon University since it was quite nearby and seems like a pretty good school to go to. And next for my career,
					I am also still not quite sure about what I would like to do for my future career but I am certain it will have much to do with technology. Hopefully everything will go well and I will at least end up with a good job that I genuinely enjoy and have
					a good life in the future. At the moment, I am still interested in editing for a company that uploads content online for many people to watch. I think I shall start off with an internship in Los Angeles, California and then hopefully get a full-time
					job there and edit for them. But then again, I am not quite sure about what exactly I will be doing in the future - these are all just thoughts. Whatever happens after high school, I just hope to get a wonderful job that I enjoy doing, live in a
					nice apartment, drive a nice, safe car, eat and live healthy, make new friends while keeping my old ones close still, and overall a fun and happy life.</p>

										<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Quantify</h3>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 7px; font-size: 16px;">I want to get all A’s in all of my classes (at least 90% in my classes).</p>
										<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Small Steps</h3>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 7px; font-size: 16px;">To achieve this goal I’ve set, I will pay more attention in my classes, understand everything necessary to exceed expectations in class, study a lot for quizzes/tests/exams, and work even harder in class (spend tons of time working and putting tons of effort into my work in each class).</p>
										<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Timeline</h3>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 7px; font-size: 16px;">I will need to get all A’s in all of my classes by the end of trimester 2 (3-09-17) and trimester 3 (6-14-17).</p>
										<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Monitoring</h3>
										<p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 17px;">I will be monitoring my grades (percentages) on synergy (the website that keeps track of my grades), but I will also be communicating with my teachers to know more about my grade/progress in the class.</p>
										<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px; text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;">Set a goal related to either an extracurricular activity, a job, or an internship.</p>
										<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Realistic</h3>
										<p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 7px;">Another goal I would like to set for myself is to get a job before the beginning of summer.</p>
										<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Quantify</h3>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 7px; font-size: 16px;">I just want to get any job that I could do and make some money from.</p>
										<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Small Steps</h3>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 7px; font-size: 16px;">To achieve this goal, I will have to get my license, apply for many jobs that I could certainly do, and show the employers that I can be a hardworking employee.</p>
										<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Timeline</h3>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 7px; font-size: 16px;">I need to complete this goal of getting a job at least before the beginning of summer, so then that way I will be ahead of the “competition” (the other teenagers applying for jobs in the summertime).</p>
										<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Monitoring</h3>
										<p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 17px;">I guess I will have to monitor this goal by checking in with the employers at the places that I am looking to work at and apply for jobs at. I will also look out for any employers that try to reach me back and hopefully take them up on the offer, if they offer a job to me.</p>
