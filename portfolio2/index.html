    	<h1 data-aos="zoom-out" style="transition: 5s;">PERSONAL LEGEND</h1>
		<p data-aos="zoom-in">I believe that the definition of a personal legend is something that is already set out for you to do and accomplish in life - you just have to find it. In Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist, the main protagonist went on a magnificent journey to discover his personal legend. Over time, the reader is taught about the essential wisdom of listening to the heart, learning to read the omens scattered about in life’s path, and, above all else, following our dreams.</p>
		<p data-aos="zoom-in">I strongly feel that my personal legend is to continue doing great in school by receiving A’s in each of my classes and move onto college to prepare myself for my future career. I will keep paying attention to my instructors in class and put the perfect amount of work into my projects. Once I graduate from high school, I will attend Southern Oregon University because it will further improve my skills for my future career, is very close to where my family is, and seems to be a great college for me. For my career itself, I knew it would have much to do with technology (more specifically video/content production) so I decided on “Emerging Media and Digital Arts” for my Bachelor of Arts degree. I am extremely glad to be in the block class of CSB right now because we are always focused on completing assignments using technology every single day! I will get even more experience with certain programs, such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere, which will greatly help me out in the future for my desired career.</p>
		<p data-aos="zoom-in">Hopefully, everything will go well after my education and I will end up with a good job that I genuinely enjoy and have an incredible, healthy life in the future. At the moment, I am still interested in editing for a company that uploads content online. After college, I want to start off my career by applying for a job as a video editor/producer at Rooster Teeth Productions at their headquarters in Austin, Texas. I think that everything will go as planned as long as I keep at it, work hard, pay attention, and just go for it. Whatever happens after high school and college, I just hope to get a wonderful job that I enjoy doing, live in a nice apartment, eat and live healthy, make new friends, and, overall, live a fun and happy life.</p>

        	<ol>
            	<li data-aos="fade-left">Academically, I will maintain my 4.0 GPA by the end of high school through hard work, communication, and concentration on the new lessons each and every day in order to ultimately exceed expectations in the classroom.</li>
                <li data-aos="fade-left">Near the end of high school, I would like to get a job by showing the employers that I can be a very hardworking employee with various skills. I also would like to begin putting more focus into eating healthy and exercising every day because I find it to be very important for both my mind and body.</li>

I will accomplish this goal by paying lots of attention to the instructors in my classes, thoroughly understanding everything that I am taught, and work extremely hard to do great in college.</li>
                <li data-aos="fade-left">If I did get a job near the end of high school, I will try my best to maintain that job and still attend college. If it starts to get too difficult for me, I will have to either go part-time or quit the job. I will also continue my healthy lifestyle by exercising daily and eating healthy.</li>

I would love to work here because I have been watching content from Rooster Teeth since I was little, I have always loved the process of making that content that so many people enjoy, and I have seen that they can be a wonderful family to join that still continues to grow today.</li>
                <li data-aos="fade-left">Aside from my career and education plan, I would love to have a great job that I really enjoy doing, work in a space that I am comfortable in, make a lot of new friends there, have a nice apartment, and live a healthy, fulfilling life. Overall, I just want to have an amazing and successful life after all of the immense effort put into my education and career so that I can make my family proud and myself happy.</li>

<h1 data-aos="zoom-out" style="transition: 5s;">THE PLAN FOR MY FUTURE</h1>
	<p data-aos="zoom-in">I plan on continuing my education by applying for Southern Oregon University in the fall of this year. If accepted, my major will be “Emerging Media and Digital Arts” because after many months of questioning myself, I finally figured out and decided that I wanted to work in “content/video production”—I chose this specific field since I knew that I just loved watching videos online, figuring out how they were made, and conducting video editing in various software programs on my own. To me, college was one of the only places to go in order to improve my skills in the field that I enjoyed the most. Nobody in my family has ever attended college before, so I am extremely excited to have the opportunity to go to an extraordinary college like Southern Oregon University and study what I am most interested in and passionate for, enhancing my editing ability and love for the career. I am also exceedingly animated to be going to SOU because I will be able to prolong my stay in beautiful southern Oregon and attend college without having to move away from my loving family and marvelous friends.</p>
	<p data-aos="zoom-in">My overall education/career plan after getting accepted into the university will be to do my absolute best in school by focusing hard on each of my classes, graduate with my beloved major after four long years of hard work and intense effort, apply for the jobs that I am very much interested in at that time, and hopefully get a job that I will really enjoy doing and one that improves my skills each and every single day—currently the specific job that I am focused on and want is a position as a video editor at Rooster Teeth Productions because they are already quite a well-known company and are still constantly growing extremely fast, I have been watching their content online for many years now and enjoy it all a lot due to the astounding work and effort put into it all, and I just genuinely enjoy editing both videos and photos in various software programs as well as improving my skills in these cool editing programs.</p>
	<p data-aos="zoom-in">I will accomplish all of these goals of mine and prepare for my career by applying for a lot of scholarships, completing any necessary college applications, studying my hardest for and completing the ACT with a good score, and finalizing the FAFSA. Once I achieve these goals and become completely prepared for my career, I will get my dream job and benefit the people of this world by producing content that puts a smile on their face and teaches them something that they can enjoy and look to for inspiration. After making these choices, I believe that I will have an absolutely unbelievable job that I really enjoy doing and gives me the ability to make the world a more positive place with inspiration, happiness, and knowledge flowing straight through its veins.</p>
