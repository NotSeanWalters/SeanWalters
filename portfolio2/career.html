		<p data-aos="zoom-in">Rooster Teeth is a production studio based in Austin, TX responsible for some of the most watched and celebrated online series ever. The company ignited an Internet revolution and helped redefine contemporary animation when it created Red vs. Blue, longest-running web and American science fiction series in history. Rooster Teeth also produces the globally acclaimed animated show RWBY, the first western anime series to be distributed in Japan, the comedy gamer series Immersion, a reality format that brings video game theory to the real world, the chart-topping RT Podcast, and hilarious live action shorts such as Million Dollars, But… and Social Disorder. With a massive global footprint of more than 20 million subscribers to its YouTube network, 3 million unique monthly visitors to RoosterTeeth.com and 1.8 million registered community members, Rooster Teeth has one of the most active and engaged fan bases in the world. In 2011, Rooster Teeth expanded into live events with RTX, an annual gaming and Internet convention held in Austin, TX, which started as a fan event for 400 people but quickly grew to attract more than 40, 000 attendees from around the world in 2015. Rooster Teeth launched its first international live event in January 2016 with RTX Australia. The company broke Indiegogo crowd funding records after rallying its dedicated fan base for Rooster Teeth's first feature film, Lazer Team, which raised $2.48M. In addition Rooster Teeth operates the popular online gaming destinations Achievement Hunter, Funhaus, The Slo Mo Guys, Kinda Funny, Cow Chop, The Know, and ScrewAttack. In November of 2014, Rooster Teeth became a subsidiary of Fullscreen, Inc., a global youth media company that develops online creators and produces multi-platform entertainment experiences.</p>

		<p data-aos="zoom-in">Rooster Teeth Productions was founded on April 1, 2003 by Matt Hullum, Burnie Burns, Geoff Ramsey, Gus Sorola, and Joel Heyman. Rooster Teeth’s first huge success began after the creation of the longest-running webseries of all time, Red vs. Blue, which premiered in April 2003. This ignited an Internet revolution and helped redefine contemporary animation. Rooster Teeth’s next big success was their following animated series, RWBY. One of the founders of Rooster Teeth Productions, Geoff Ramsey, created a division within Rooster Teeth, named Achievement Hunter in 2008. Geoff constructed a team of gamers and entertainers to make up Achievement Hunter at the time, and later on they would triple in numbers. This was their first division made within Rooster Teeth and it was the go to spot for gaming related things under Rooster Teeth on the Internet. Overtime, more and more divisions were created and this is what makes Rooster Teeth unique compared to other related online gaming related outlets. For example, a team working at Inside Gaming, a division within Machinima, left the company and was brought on by Rooster Teeth to create their next huge division, Funhaus. Each division at Rooster Teeth has their own little niche to satisfy the different needs content consumers need on the Internet. Rooster Teeth since then has been adding onto their diverse cast of teams and members to construct a beautiful company with many different flavors for their audience to watch, love, and relate with.</p>

    	<h1 data-aos="zoom-out" style="transition: 5s;">Why Working At Rooster Teeth Productions Would Be A Good Fit For Me</h1>
		<p data-aos="zoom-in">Firstly, I have been watching Rooster Teeth content for a long time and I have followed along with them on their journey throughout, ever since around 2011. I have melded relationships with the employees I see through their content, learning more about them, and their personalities. They have grown to be Internet Personalities and they seem like awesome people to get to work with. I really hope to work with these people that I have known, in a way, in the future because they appear to really genuinely enjoy their jobs entertaining others, producing, and editing tons of content for the world to see. They are all very different people from each other who have incredible chemistry and I could add on to that. Working there will help me improve upon my ability to create content, from editing photo and video to keeping track of equipment and other important things in order to have great production. Since I already know how to do some of those things and I am certainly open for improvement, I think it is a great place to work at. I would just love to be around these amazing people and work alongside with them, improving my skills and helping carry Rooster Teeth further with my drive, video by video.</p>
